## Using
<hr>
For this project, it is recommended to use Cocoapods version 0.39.0.  We have found that using a newer version, such as 1.0.1, continues to cause issues in the building process for project frameworks.

## Installing Cocoapods
<hr>
To install the proper version of Cocoapods for this project, first uninstall the current version of Cocoapods on your system.

Open Terminal.
`sudo gem uninstall cocoapods`

Enter your password, hit enter, enter "Y", and continue.  This will uninstall Cocoapods from your system.

Next install Cocoapods version 0.39.0.
`sudo gem install cocoapods -v 0.39.0`

## Importing Project Dependencies & Frameworks

In Terminal, when inside the project folder, enter `pod install` and press return.  The packaging manager will then analyze the project requirements and install the necessary dependencies.  Build your project!
